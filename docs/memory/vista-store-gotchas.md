Durable lessons from the P1 vista-store build (2026-07-05):

- **`node:sqlite` rows are null-prototype objects.** `assert.deepEqual`
  against object literals fails on the prototype, and consumers get
  surprising objects. The engine wrapper (`src/store/engine.ts`) copies
  every row to a plain object — keep that invariant if the wrapper is
  ever reworked or swapped to better-sqlite3.
- **Import-extension split in this template:** non-test sources must use
  `.js` specifiers (`from './release.js'`) because tsc has no
  `allowImportingTsExtensions`; test files may use `.ts` only because
  tsconfig *excludes* `**/*.test.ts` from typecheck (tsx resolves both
  at runtime). Type-ONLY `.ts` imports also pass (erased). A standalone
  script outside the repo needs an `.mts` extension for tsx to treat it
  as ESM.

- **CJS bundle vs `import.meta.url`:** the extension bundles to
  CommonJS (`dist/extension.cjs` — the extension host requires CJS,
  and `"type": "module"` makes plain `.js` ESM). Any module-top-level
  `import.meta.url` becomes `undefined` in that bundle and crashes at
  LOAD time ("Invalid URL") — keep such code lazy and path-injectable,
  and have ext code import specific modules, never the package root.
- **The in-VSCode smoke is the real gate for ext code:**
  `npm run test:vscode` (installed-binary @vscode/test-electron, no
  download) caught both the bundle crash and the numeric-tag grammar
  gap that 148 unit tests could not.

**Why:** all of these bit during P1/P3 (red gates / failed runs).
**How to apply:** don't "fix" the row-copy in engine.ts as an
optimization without re-running the deepEqual tests; when adding a new
src module, write `.js` specifiers even though sibling test files say
`.ts`.

Design invariant worth keeping: `checkMetaDb` takes the ai-manifest
catalog as an **input** — never hardcode the schema in this repo
(proposal §3.2); the catalog's acquisition path changes when the
producer publishes ai-manifest.json as a release asset (tracked in
[[../compass-v2-tracker.md]] → actually see `docs/compass-v2-tracker.md`).
